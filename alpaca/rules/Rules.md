# Alpaca Game Rules

## Game Idea
Your main goal is to get the least amount of points after the game has ended. To do so, you need to be smart about staying in a round while trying to get rid of all your cards or to drop out of the round and take some points. The first person to get rid of all their cards wins the round. They then can get rid of either one or ten points depending on how many points they have. The game ends when the first player has 40 or more points. The player with the least amount of points wins.

## Playing the game

### Game Preparation
Every Player gets six cards, the remaining cards are the draw cards. The top card is drawn and put onto the discard pile. Now the game can start.

### Playing a turn

The player has three choices: Play a card, draw a card oder leave the round.

1. Play a Card
The top card of the discard pile determines, which card you can play. You can either play a card with the same value or a card that is exactly one higher. The alpaca card can be played on top of a six. Following the alpaca card you can play another alpaca or a one.

2. Draw a Card
Draw a card from the card pile. After that you are not allowed to play a card and yout turn ends.
*Important:* If the draw pile is empty, you can not draw a card. You can either play a card or leave the round.

3. Leave the round
You can leave the round. You are not allowed to do any more actions in that round.

### End of a round
A round ends imediatly if:
* a player has discarded all of his/her cards, or
* all players have left the round

If all other players have left the round, you can play further on your own, but you are only allowed to play your remaining cards

### Counting points
Every player receives points for their remaining cards. Every card counts its value as point, the alpaca counts as ten points. *Every value counts only once!* I.e. if you have  the card with the number 2 twice, you will only receive two points. Minus points are counted with coins. A black coin equals ten points, a white coin equals one point. If you have ten white coins, they will be exchanged for one black coin.

### Getting rid of points
If you are the lucky player, who has managed to play all of their cards, you can get rid of one coin, no matter if it is a black (10) or a white (1) one.
