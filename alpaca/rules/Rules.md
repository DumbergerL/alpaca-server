# Alpaca Game Rules

## Game Idea
Your main goal is to drop all coins that you gain. Try to be the first who can get rid of all his cards, otherwise you will take punishment points. If you cant play a card on your hand, you need to make a decission. Leave the game or take a card from the cardpile. You will receive the minus points in coins. If you drop all cards you can also drop a coin. And that one can have the value one or ten. 
Who has the fewest minus points wins the game!

## Game Preparation
Every Player gets six Handcards, the remaining cards form the discard pile. The top card is now turned to top and will now be the discard pile.

Now the Game starts:

A player has only three options: Play a card, draw a card oder leave the round.

1. Play a Card
The top card ot the discardpile defines, what card you can play. You can play a card with the same value or a card thats ist exactly one higher. The alpaca card can be played on top of a six or on top of an alpaca card. On an alpaca card you can play a one.

2. Draw a Card
Draw a card from the card pile. After that you are not allowed to play a card, the next player is on turn.
*Important:* If the cardpile is empty, you can not draw a card. So you either play a card or leave the round.

3. Leave the round
You can leave the round. So in this round you are not allowed to do any actions.

## End of a round
A round ends imediatly if:
* one player played all his handcard or
* all players have left the round.

If all other players has left the round, you can play further on your own. But you are only allowed to draw cards.

## Cash Up
For the remaining hand cards, you will receive minus points. Every card counts its value als minus point, the alpaca counts als ten minus points. But every value counts just once. I.e. if you have left three times the card 2, you will only receive two minus points. You will receive the minus points in coins. A black coin equals 10 minus points, a white coin equals 1 minus points. If you collected ten white coins, you can change them to one black coin.

## Drop Chips
If you are the lucky player, who has played all his cards. You can drop one coin, no matter if it is a black (10) or a white (1) one.
